## 🔄 Flip Game — Card Matching Game

A fun and interactive **Flip Game** where players reveal number cards and test their memory by matching pairs.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project focuses on game state management, user interaction, and visual feedback without using any external libraries or frameworks.

The objective is to remember card positions and match pairs correctly to win the game.

## ✨ Gameplay Rules

- Cards are placed face down at the start
- Clicking a card flips it to reveal its value
- Players flip two cards at a time
- If the cards do not match, they flip back after a short delay
- When both the card contain the "#" symbol, the player wins the game

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML** — game structure and card layout
- **CSS** — styling, layout, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** — game logic, state tracking, and interactions

## 📌 What I Learned

- Managing temporary and persistent game states
- Implementing timed UI updates (flip-back logic)
- Comparing card values and tracking matched pairs
